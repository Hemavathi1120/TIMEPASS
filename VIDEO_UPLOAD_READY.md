## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Video won't upload?

**1. Check the error message** (it will tell you what's wrong!)
- "CORS policy" → Set up Cloudinary in `.env.local`
- "File too large" → Video exceeds 200MB
- "Network error" → Check internet connection

**2. Verify Cloudinary setup**
```bash
# Check if .env.local has your credentials
cat .env.local
```

**3. Try a smaller video first** (< 10MB) to test if it works

**4. Check browser console** (F12 → Console tab) for detailed errors

**5. Restart the dev server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Upload is very slow?

- **Use Cloudinary** (much faster than Firebase!)
- **Try smaller video** or compress it
- **Check internet speed** (need at least 5 Mbps)
- **Be patient** with large files (200MB can take 2-5 minutes)
