# Story Viewers & Likers Feature - Instagram-Style Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive Instagram-style story viewers and likers tracking system. Users can now see exactly who has viewed their stories and who has liked them, with timestamps and the ability to navigate to viewer profiles.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **StoryViewersDialog Component** (`StoryViewersDialog.tsx`)
A beautiful, animated dialog that displays story viewers and likers in separate tabs.

#### Key Features:
- **Dual Tabs Interface**: Separate tabs for "Views" and "Likes"
- **Real-time Counts**: Live badge counts showing total viewers/likers
- **User Profiles**: Clickable user cards that navigate to profiles
- **Timestamp Display**: Shows when each view/like occurred with relative time ("2h ago", "Just now", etc.)
- **Avatar Rings**: Purple ring for viewers, red ring for likers
- **Empty States**: Beautiful empty states with encouraging messages
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion animations for opening, closing, and list items
- **Mobile Optimized**: Bottom sheet on mobile, centered dialog on desktop

#### UI Components:
```typescript
- Backdrop with blur effect
- Gradient header with "Story Activity" title
- Tab navigation with icon + count badges
- Scrollable list with user cards
- Avatar with colored ring (purple for views, red for likes)
- Username and time ago display
- Icon indicators (Eye for views, filled Heart for likes)
- Hover effects and animations
```

### 2. **Enhanced StoryViewer Component** (`StoryViewer.tsx`)

#### New State Management:
```typescript
const [likeCount, setLikeCount] = useState(0);
const [showViewersDialog, setShowViewersDialog] = useState(false);
```

#### Updated Functions:

**recordStoryView()** - Now also fetches like count:
```typescript
// Fetch the total likes count
const totalLikesQuery = query(
  collection(db, 'stories', currentStory.id, 'likes')
);
const totalLikesSnapshot = await getDocs(totalLikesQuery);
setLikeCount(totalLikesSnapshot.size);
```

**handleLikeStory()** - Enhanced with duplicate prevention:
```typescript
// Check if user already liked this story
const likesQuery = query(
  collection(db, 'stories', currentStory.id, 'likes'),
  where('userId', '==', currentUser.uid)
);
const likesSnapshot = await getDocs(likesQuery);

if (!likesSnapshot.empty) {
  toast({
    title: "Already liked",
    description: "You've already liked this story"
  });
  return;
}

// Update like count locally for instant feedback
setLikeCount(prev => prev + 1);
```

#### Updated UI - Clickable Stats Badge:
```tsx
{/* View and Like count badges - Clickable for own stories */}
{userId === currentUser?.uid && (viewCount > 0 || likeCount > 0) && (
  <motion.button
    onClick={(e) => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      setShowViewersDialog(true);
      pauseStory(); // Pause while viewing stats
    }}
    className="ml-2 flex items-center gap-2 bg-black/30 backdrop-blur-sm px-3 py-1.5 rounded-full hover:bg-black/50 transition-all cursor-pointer"
    whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
    whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}
  >
    {/* Green dot + view count */}
    {viewCount > 0 && (
      <div className="flex items-center gap-1 text-white/90 text-xs">
        <div className="w-1.5 h-1.5 bg-green-400 rounded-full" />
        <span className="font-medium">{viewCount}</span>
      </div>
    )}
    
    {/* Red heart + like count */}
    {likeCount > 0 && (
      <div className="flex items-center gap-1 text-white/90 text-xs">
        <Heart className="w-3 h-3 fill-red-500 text-red-500" />
        <span className="font-medium">{likeCount}</span>
      </div>
    )}
  </motion.button>
)}
```

## Database Structure

### Stories Collection:
```
stories/
  {storyId}/
    userId: string
    mediaUrl: string
    caption: string
    createdAt: Timestamp
    expiresAt: Timestamp
    viewCount: number (optional, incremented)
    
    views/ (subcollection)
      {viewId}/
        userId: string
        createdAt: Timestamp
    
    likes/ (subcollection)
      {likeId}/
        userId: string
        createdAt: Timestamp
```

### Notifications Collection:
```
notifications/
  {notificationId}/
    type: 'story_like'
    toUserId: string (story owner)
    fromUserId: string (liker)
    storyId: string
    read: boolean
    createdAt: Timestamp
```

## User Flow

### Viewing Your Own Story:
1. User opens their own story
2. See clickable badge in header showing: "👁️ 15  ❤️ 8"
3. Click badge → StoryViewersDialog opens, story pauses
4. Switch between "Views" and "Likes" tabs
5. See list of users with avatars, usernames, and time
6. Click any user → Navigate to their profile, close viewer
7. Close dialog → Story resumes playing

### Viewing Someone Else's Story:
1. User opens someone's story
2. No stats badge visible (privacy - only owner sees stats)
3. Can like the story with heart button
4. Can comment on the story
5. Their view is automatically recorded
6. Story owner gets notification of the like

### Liking a Story:
1. Click heart button while viewing story
2. Animated heart flies across screen
3. Like is recorded in Firestore
4. Like count updates immediately
5. Owner receives notification (if not own story)
6. Prevents duplicate likes with toast message

## Privacy & Permissions

### What Story Owners See:
✅ Complete list of who viewed their story
✅ Complete list of who liked their story
✅ Timestamps for all views and likes
✅ Clickable stats badge showing counts

### What Other Users See:
❌ Cannot see who else viewed the story
❌ Cannot see who else liked the story
❌ No stats badge visible
✅ Can view and like the story normally

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. **Performance Optimizations**
- Lazy loading of viewer/liker data (only fetched when dialog opens)
- Sorted by most recent first
- Efficient Firestore queries with subcollections
- Local state updates for instant feedback

### 2. **Animation System**
```typescript
// Dialog entrance/exit
initial={{ y: "100%", opacity: 0 }}
animate={{ y: 0, opacity: 1 }}
exit={{ y: "100%", opacity: 0 }}

// List item stagger
initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -20 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}

// Hover effects
whileHover={{ scale: 1.02 }}
whileTap={{ scale: 0.98 }}
```

### 3. **Story Pause/Resume Logic**
```typescript
// Pause story when opening viewers dialog
onClick={() => {
  setShowViewersDialog(true);
  pauseStory();
}}

// Resume story when closing dialog
onClose={() => {
  setShowViewersDialog(false);
  resumeStory();
}}
```

### 4. **Time Formatting**
```typescript
const formatTimeAgo = (date: Date) => {
  const seconds = Math.floor((new Date().getTime() - date.getTime()) / 1000);
  
  if (seconds < 60) return 'Just now';
  if (seconds < 3600) return `${Math.floor(seconds / 60)}m ago`;
  if (seconds < 86400) return `${Math.floor(seconds / 3600)}h ago`;
  if (seconds < 604800) return `${Math.floor(seconds / 86400)}d ago`;
  return date.toLocaleDateString();
};
```

## UI/UX Design Decisions

### 1. **Color Coding**
- **Green dot**: Views (neutral, informative)
- **Red heart**: Likes (emotional, positive)
- **Purple ring**: Viewer avatars (professional)
- **Red ring**: Liker avatars (passionate)

### 2. **Badge Design**
- Compact pill shape with backdrop blur
- Hover effect: slight scale up + darker background
- Shows both metrics side by side
- Only visible to story owner

### 3. **Empty States**
- Large icon (opacity 30%)
- Primary message: "No views yet"
- Secondary message: Encouraging call-to-action
- Maintains visual hierarchy

### 4. **Mobile Responsiveness**
- Bottom sheet on mobile (natural thumb reach)
- Centered dialog on desktop (visual balance)
- Smooth spring animations for natural feel
- Full-width on mobile, max-width on desktop
