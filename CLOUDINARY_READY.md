   - Or clear cache in browser settings

3. **Check console for errors**:
   - Press F12
   - Look at Console tab
   - Check for any error messages

4. **Verify environment variables loaded**:
   - In browser console, type:
     ```javascript
     import.meta.env.VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
     import.meta.env.VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET
     ```
   - Should show: `dobktsnix` and `Timepass`
