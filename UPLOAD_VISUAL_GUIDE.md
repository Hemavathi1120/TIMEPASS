# 🎬 VIDEO UPLOAD FIXED - Visual Guide

## 🚨 The Problem

```
❌ Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com...'
   from origin 'http://localhost:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

## ✅ The Solution

Your code now has **3 layers of protection**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. TRY CLOUDINARY (If configured)      │
│     ↓ NO CORS ISSUES!                   │
│     ↓ Upload directly via API           │
│     ↓                                    │
│  2. FALLBACK TO FIREBASE                │
│     ↓ With retry logic (3 attempts)     │
│     ↓ Better error handling             │
│     ↓                                    │
│  3. CLEAR ERROR MESSAGES                │
│     ↓ Tell you exactly what went wrong  │

✅ Automatic image compression
✅ Smooth progress animations
✅ Better visual feedback
✅ CORS errors? Use Cloudinary instead!
```

```
project-root/
  ├── src/
  ├── public/
  ├── package.json
  └── .env          ← HERE!

Get-Content .env

# Should see:
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-actual-name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=timepass_unsigned
```

### Check Cloudinary:
1. Login to dashboard
2. Check "Media Library" → "timepass" folder
