## üé¨ How It Works Now

### Upload Flow:
```
1. User uploads video
   ‚Üì
2. Video uploads to Cloudinary
   ‚Üì
3. Post saved to Firestore with mediaType: 'video'
   ‚Üì
4. User automatically navigated to /reels
   ‚Üì
5. Reels page queries posts with mediaType === 'video'
   ‚Üì
6. Videos appear in Reels feed!
```

### Feed Separation:
```
üì± HOME FEED:
- Photos (mediaType: 'image')
- Other media types
- NO videos

üé¨ REELS:
- Videos ONLY (mediaType: 'video')
- Vertical scroll format
- Auto-play functionality
```

## üîç Debug & Verify

### Check Console Logs:

**When uploading a video:**
```
üì§ Uploading video to Cloudinary...
‚úÖ video upload successful!
üìù Creating post with data: { mediaType: 'video', ... }
‚úÖ Post created successfully with ID: xyz123
üé¨ Media type: video
```

**When viewing Reels:**
```
üîç Fetching video reels from Firestore...
üìä Found 3 video posts
üé¨ Video post xyz123: { mediaType: 'video', ... }
‚úÖ Loaded 3 reels
‚úÖ Video loaded successfully: xyz123
```

### Check Firestore Database:

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Open `posts` collection
4. Find your video post
5. Verify fields:
   ```json
   {
     "authorId": "user123",
     "media": ["https://res.cloudinary.com/..."],
     "mediaType": "video",  ‚Üê Should be "video" not "image"
     "caption": "Check this out!",
     "createdAt": { ... },
     "likesCount": 0,
     "commentsCount": 0,
     "visibility": "public"
   }
   ```

### Check Video URL:

1. Copy the video URL from Firestore
2. Open in new browser tab
3. Should play directly
4. URL format should be:
   ```
   https://res.cloudinary.com/dobktsnix/video/upload/...
   ```
