## 📝 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Sign Up (2 minutes)
1. Go to: https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free
2. Sign up with email or Google
3. Verify your email

### Step 2: Get Credentials (1 minute)
After login, you'll see your **Dashboard**:

```
Cloud name: dobktsnix (example - yours will be different)
API Key: 123456789012345
API Secret: ABC123xyz (not needed)
```

**Copy your Cloud Name!**

### Step 3: Create Upload Preset (2 minutes)
1. Click **Settings** (gear icon) → **Upload**
2. Scroll to **Upload presets**
3. Click **Add upload preset**
4. Configure:
   - **Preset name:** `timepass_unsigned`
   - **Signing mode:** Select **"Unsigned"** ⚠️ IMPORTANT!
   - **Folder:** `timepass/posts` (optional)
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Create .env File
In your project root (same folder as `package.json`), create a file named `.env`:

```env
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name-here
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=timepass_unsigned
```

**Replace `your-cloud-name-here` with your actual cloud name!**

Example:
```env
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dobktsnix
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=timepass_unsigned
```

### Step 5: Restart Dev Server
```powershell
# Stop server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then start again:
npm run dev
```

### Still Having Issues?

**Check These:**

1. **`.env` file location:**

   - NOT in `src/` folder
   - File name is exactly `.env` (no `.txt`)

2. **Variable names:**
   - Must start with `VITE_`
   - Check spelling exactly

3. **Upload preset:**
   - Name must be `timepass_unsigned`
   - Must be **Unsigned** mode (not Signed)
   - Check it exists in Cloudinary dashboard

4. **Dev server:**
   - Must restart AFTER creating `.env`
   - Stop with Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev` again

|---------|-----------|------------------|
| CORS Issues | ❌ None | ✅ Requires setup |
| Video Optimization | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Manual |
| Free Storage | 25GB | 5GB |
| Free Bandwidth | 25GB/month | 1GB/day |

## 🎯 What Changed in Your Code?

Your upload component now:
1. **Checks for Cloudinary config** first
2. **Falls back to Firebase** if not configured
3. **Shows better progress** indicators
4. **Retries failed uploads** (3 attempts)
5. **Validates file sizes** (100MB videos, 10MB images)
6. **Compresses images** automatically

## 🔧 Firebase Storage (Alternative)

If you prefer Firebase Storage:

### Option A: Google Cloud SDK (Full Fix)
```powershell
# 1. Download installer
https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe

# 2. After installation, restart PowerShell and run:
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project timepass-df191
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://timepass-df191.appspot.com
```

### Option B: Firebase Console (Partial Fix)
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/timepass-df191/storage/rules
2. Update rules to allow all authenticated users
3. May not fully fix CORS for uploads
