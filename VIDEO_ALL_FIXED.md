## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Video not appearing?

**Check browser console (F12):**
- Look for emoji logs: 🎬 ✅ ❌ 📤
- Any red errors?
- Does it say "Found 0 video posts"?

**Check Firestore:**
- Firebase Console → Firestore Database
- Collection: `posts`
- Your post has `mediaType: "video"`?

### Video uploaded but won't play?

**Check video URL:**
- Open Firestore
- Copy video URL from `media` field
- Paste in new browser tab
- Does it play?

**If yes** → CORS issue, check console
**If no** → Re-upload video
