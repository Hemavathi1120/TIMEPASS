# üé• Video Upload Fixed - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

1. **Increased video size limit**: 100MB ‚Üí 200MB
2. **Enhanced Cloudinary support** for video uploads (CORS-free!)
3. **Better error handling** with specific messages
4. **Improved progress tracking** for large video files
5. **Separate folders** for videos and images in Cloudinary
6. **Video-specific upload optimizations**

## üöÄ How to Use

### Option 1: Cloudinary (RECOMMENDED - No CORS Issues!)

**Step 1: Configure Cloudinary**
1. Open `.env.local` file (already created)
2. Update with your Cloudinary credentials:
   ```
   VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name-here
   VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=timepass_unsigned
   ```

**Step 2: Get Cloudinary Credentials**
- Go to https://cloudinary.com/console
- Sign up or log in
- Find your **Cloud Name** in the dashboard
- Create an **unsigned upload preset**:
  - Go to Settings > Upload > Upload Presets
  - Click "Add upload preset"
  - Set signing mode to "Unsigned"
  - Name it `timepass_unsigned`
  - Save

**Step 3: Restart Dev Server**
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Firebase Storage (May Have CORS Issues)

If you don't configure Cloudinary, the app will fall back to Firebase Storage.

**Firebase Storage Rules** (already configured in Firebase Console):
```json
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
